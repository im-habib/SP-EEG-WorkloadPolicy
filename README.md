# SP-EEG-WorkloadPolicy

Official implementation of the paper: **"An Adaptive Policy-Based Framework for Driver Workload Sparse EEG Classification"** (Submitted to EMBC 2026).

This repository contains an end-to-end Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) pipeline to classify cognitive workload levels from sparse 4-channel EEG data (Muse S) using the **CL-Drive** dataset.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Policy-Based Classification:** Treats workload monitoring as a sequential decision process rather than isolated frame classification.
- **Stability Optimization:** Implements a custom **Temporal Switching Penalty** in the reward function to eliminate "label flickering."
- **Sparse-EEG Support:** Optimized for low-density (4-channel) wearable EEG configurations.
- **Subject-Independent Validation:** Full Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) cross-validation pipeline included.

## 📊 Methodology

### State Representation

We extract **Differential Entropy (DE)** across four frequency bands () for each of the 4 EEG channels, resulting in a 16-dimensional state vector .

### Reward Design

To balance accuracy and stability, we define:
